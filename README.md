## RadCalculator

Rad Calculator is a Java implementation of the sin, cos, and tan trigonometric functions.

# Example Usage

``` 
sin(1) // returns the radian value of sin(1)
cos(1) // returns the radian value of cos(1)
tan(1) // returns the radian value of tan(1)

degSin(180) // returns the radian value of sin(π)
degCos(180) // returns the radian value of cos(π)
degTan(180) // returns the radian value of tan(π)
```
